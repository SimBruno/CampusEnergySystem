## Degrees of Freedom (DOF) analysis

**Given:**

The VALI model of the 2-stage heat pump with tags set to OFF (the default working fluid is R290, you should not change it) â€“ *R-290.bls*. 

A csv file with 5 combinations of sets, only one of which is correct.

**Task**

Perform a DOF analysis to identify which tags must be set to CST and which ones must remain OFF.

Activate the tags and make sure the model is running properly.

*Hint*: For each component, identify how many measurements are needed for mass and energy balances, how many measurements are set as parameters and how many are calculated by the model. 

**Result**

## Introduction

In order to perform a DOF analysis, the needed ingredients are necessary: 

- The state variables of the flows
- The balance equations, often being energy balance (EB), mass balance (MB), pressure drop (P) 
- The model/performances equations, describing how the unit act on an engineering perspective.

The state variables of the flows are characterized by a minimum number of state variables given by the Gibbs phase rule, i.e. for a stream of N compounds, N+2 variables are sufficient to fully characterize it, with at least one extensive variable. From that, all other properties can be derived, provided the right constitutive equations.

For this analysis, we'll consider the steady-state operation of the system.

## System DOF analysis

A simple preliminary analysis allows to determine the overall minimum DOF of the system, giving a lower bound of measurements necessary to make it solvable. Representing the system as a flowsheet allows to retrieve the number of variables and equations. The variables consists of all the material flows, the electricity flows and the heat flows, assuming that each material flows bring 3 variables. The equations are one mass balance and one energy balance per unit in the system, the isentropic efficiencies for both compressor as well as the isenthalpic expansions in the valves. Finally, having 9 flows, all of them having 1 phase, and 8 units yields:

$n_s = n_v - n_e =  (27+4+2)- (8+8+2+2) = 13$

And thus $n_s = 13$, meaning that we need at least 13 specifications to characterize the whole system. 

### VALI tags propositions
For this exercise, we're provided with 5 sets of possible tag arrangement. To goal is to determine which one of those is possible based on the DOF analysis. As we can see in (@tbl-DOFprop), all arrangement meet the minimum measurement requirements. However, we're not certain that the local DOF is respected. Summing $n_s$ for each unit processs and substracting the link between them should allow to determine to total number of DOF of the system taking local DOF into account. Since all tag arrangement provide a different number of set points, the solution should be given by the arrangement with matching number of DOF.

## Unit models

For the sake of completeness, we present here the general unit models composing the system.

## Compressor
Stating the unit model for a single compressor with one inlet stream and one outlet stream yields:

| Type  | Variables                                      | #        |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|----------|
| $n_x$ | $(n_{in}+n_{out})*(n_c+2)$                     | 6        |
| $n_p$ | $\Delta P$                                     | 2        |
|       | $\dot{W}_{in}$                                 |          |
| $n_t$ | $\eta_{is}$                                    | 1        |
| $n_v$ |                                                | 9        |

| Type  | Equations                                      | #        |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|----------|
| (MB)  | $\dot{m}_{in} = \dot{m}_{out}$                 | 1        |
| (EB)  | $\dot{W}_{in}= \dot{m}_{in}c_p(T_{out}-T_{in})$| 1        |
| (P)   | $\Delta P=cst$                                 | 1        |
| (M)   | $\dot{W}_{in} =\eta_{is}\dot{W}_{in,is}$       | 1        |
| $n_e$ |                                                | 4        |

And thus $n_s = n_x-n_e= 2$, meaning we need 5 specifications to characterize a compressor.

## Evaporator
For the evaporator, we proceed the same way. We model the heat exchange of the lake as a constant heat transfer, allowing to simplify the equation statement since only our main flow has to be considered. In the general case, the fluid enters the evaporator with a vapor quality $x_{in}<1$, but based on the assumption that the entering flow is purely gaseous allows to further simplify the modelisation. 

| Type  | Variables                                      | #        |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|----------|
| $n_x$ | $(n_{in}+n_{out})*(n_c+2)$                     | 6        |
| $n_p$ | $\Delta P$                                     | 1        |
|       | $\dot{Q}_{in}$                                 | 1        |
| $n_t$ | $\eta_{is}$                                    | 1        |
| $n_v$ |                                                | 9        |

| Type  | Equations                                        | #        |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| (MB)  | $\dot{m}_{in} = \dot{m}_{out}$                   | 1        |
| (EB)  | $\dot{Q}_{in}= \dot{m}_{in}c_p(T_{evap}-T_{in})$ | 1        |
| (P)   | $\Delta P=0$                                     | 1        |
| (M)   | $\dot{Q}_{in}= UA\cdot \text{LMTD}$              | 1        |
| $n_e$ |                                                  | 4        |

And thus $n_s = n_x-n_e= 2$, meaning we need 5 specifications to characterize a compressor.

## Condensor
The VALI model suggest to model the condensor in two part: one taking care of the change of temperature (sensible), the second one modelling the phase change (latent). Using the same logic as the evaporator, only the main flow is considered and the other flows are modeled as heat transfer. The unit model equation will be the same for both condensor, and only the heat transfer model will vary. The base variables are the following:

| Type  | Variables                                      | #        |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|----------|
| $n_x$ | $(n_{in}+n_{out})*(n_c+2)$                     | 6        |
| $n_p$ | $\Delta P$                                     | 1        |
|       | $\dot{Q}$                                      | 1        |
| $n_t$ |                                                | 0        |
| $n_v$ |                                                | 8        |

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Sensible condensor
The model equation for the sensible condensor is to assume a constant pressure during the heat transfer:

| Type  | Equations                                        | #        |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| (MB)  | $\dot{m}_{in} = \dot{m}_{out}$                   | 1        |
| (EB)  | $\dot{Q}_{in}= \dot{m}_{in}c_p(T_{out}-T_{in})$  | 1        |
| (P)   | $\Delta P=0$                                     | 1        |
| (M)   | $\dot{Q}_{in}= UA\cdot \text{LMTD}$              | 1        |
| $n_e$ |                                                  | 4        |

And thus $n_s = n_x-n_e = 2$, meaning that we need 2 specifications to characterize the sensible condensor.


### Latent condensor
The model equation for the latent condensor is to assume a constant temperature during the heat transfer:

| Type  | Equations                                        | #        |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| (MB)  | $\dot{m}_{in} = \dot{m}_{out}$                   | 1        |
| (EB)  | $\dot{Q}_{in}= \dot{m}_{in}\cdot L$              | 1        |
| (P)   | $\Delta P=0$                                     | 1        |
| (M)   | $\dot{Q}_{in}= UA\cdot \text{LMTD}$              | 1        |
| $n_e$ |                                                  | 4        |

And thus $n_s = n_x-n_e = 2$, meaning that we need 2 specifications to characterize the latent condensor.

## Expansion valve

Assuming the expansion valves are not going through a phase change allows to ignore the vapor quality for both valves. The model implies an isenthalpic pressure drop.

| Type  | Variables                                      | #        |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|----------|
| $n_x$ | $(n_{in}+n_{out})*(n_c+2)$                     | 6        |
| $n_p$ | $\Delta P$                                     | 1        |
| $n_t$ | -                                              | 0        |
| $n_v$ |                                                | 7        |

| Type  | Equations                                        | #        |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| (MB)  | $\dot{m}_{in} = \dot{m}_{out}$                   | 1        |
| (EB)  | $0 = \dot{m}_{in}c_p(T_{out}-T_{in})$            | 1        |
| (P)   | $\Delta P = cst$                                 | 1        |
| (M)   | $h_{in}=h_{out}$                                 | 1        |
| $n_e$ |                                                  | 4        |


And thus $n_s = n_v-n_e= 3$, meaning we need 3 specifications to characterize a pressure valve.


## Flash tank

The flash tank involves a little bit more of complexity due to the multiple flows mixing. 

| Type  | Variables                                      | #        |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|----------|
| $n_x$ | $(n_{in}+n_{out})*(n_c+2)$                     | 12       |
| $n_p$ | $\Delta P_1$                                   | 2        |
| $n_p$ | $\Delta P_2$                                   |          |
| $n_t$ | -                                              | 0        |
| $n_v$ |                                                | 14       |

| Type  | Equations                                        | #        |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| (MB)  | $\dot{m}_{in} = \dot{m}_{out}$                   | 2        |
| (MB)  | $\dot{m}_{in} = \dot{m}_{out}$                   |          |
| (EB)  | $0 = \dot{m}_{in}c_p(T_{out}-T_{in})$            | 1        |
| (P)   | $\Delta P_1 = 0$                                 | 2        |
| (P)   | $\Delta P_2 = 0$                                 |          |
| (M)   |                                                  |          |
| $n_e$ |                                                  | 5        |


And thus $n_s = n_x-n_e= 2$, meaning we need 5 specifications to characterize a flash tank.

## VALI Tags selection
Now that all the types of unit models are characterized, it should be possible to determine the minimum number of measurements needed to make the system fully determined. While it should be possible to analytically compute the required number of DOF by summing the units models and substracting the links between them, it's also possible to discard a some options by looking at redundancies/overspecifications, which will prevent VALI from running:

- `Option 2`: All values are specified in the following equation $\Delta T_{min}=T_6-T_{out,bis}$, which makes the model overspecified.

- `Option 3`: All values are specified in the following equation $Q_{cond,load}=Q_{cond,sens}+Q_{cond,lat}$, which makes the model overspecified.

- `Option 5`: All values are specified in the following equation $COP_{real}=\dfrac{Q_{cond,load}}{Q_{cond,load}-Q_{evap}}$, which makes the model overspecified.

Doing that only leaves us with one viable options, which is `Option 4`. Using that set of inputs indeed let VALI run and reconcile data. Now that the model is running with our default fluid, we can inquire for other working fluids. 

### Model adjustment to a second working fluid 

Let's choose a new working fluid from @fig-working-fluid
```{r working_fluid, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Selected refrigerants for the study', echo=F, fig.show='hold'}
#| label: fig-working-fluid
knitr::include_graphics('Figures/working_fluid.png')
```

The modern challenge of working fluid selection resides in balancing good thermal properties, long lifetime and environmental friendliness. As the latter is one of the critical parameters for all the project, let's ensure to use a fluid with a small global warming potential. The choice restricts to either Ammonia or Propylene. Even though propylene is far more expansive, it has a better chemical stability, i.e. lifetime. For our application, this is quite important. Finally, let's review the thermal properties and safety guidelines of propylene, to make the final decision:

FOR Louis: Add propylene thermal properties and compare with a basic common working fluid.

<!-- **Task**

Adjust the model from the previous section to a second working fluid of your choice between the 7 options listed in Table 4.1.

*Hints*:

- Modify the working fluid (Thermod) in your simulation file.
- Correct the pressure ratio of the compressors so that the high-pressure level corresponds to the saturation pressure for the desired condensation temperature.
- Adjust the flow rate so that the heat pump has a heating capacity of 6000 kW (the maximum capacity of the HP is in this magnitude).

**Result**

Working model of the 2-stage HP for the working fluid of your choice. -->

## Data reconciliation

Now that the double stage heat pump model is working for both fluids, let's get precise measurements. Experts provided us some measurements at different ambient temperatures, for both fluids and for low (50Â°C) and medium (65Â°C) temperature supply. Some measurements are redundant with the model. This is very good for us. Since the measurements may have errors due to sensors accuracy, bad calibration or random errors, we have the ability to correct them via data reconciliation.

Let $y_i$ (for $i=1,...,N_{mes}$) be a variable of the model which can be measured. Let $y_i^*$ be the actual measurement of $y_i$, measured with a sensor that has a standard deviation of $\sigma_i$. Let $x_j$ be a variable of the model that wasn't measured. Let's write the set of all $y_i$ and all $x_j$ as vectors: $X,Y$. Finally, let's write the model equations as constrains: $F(X,Y)=0$. Reconciliation aims getting a set of solutions which minimzes the total square error between model and measurements, weighted by each sensor accuracy. Therefore, the problem can be written:

$$\min_{X,Y} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{mes}}\left( \dfrac{y_i-y_i^*}{\sigma_i} \right)^2$$
$$\text{s.t. } F(X,Y)=0$$


Vali is able to perform data reconciliation when a measurement file is provided. Therefore, reconciled files are generated for both fluids and for both temperature supplies.
<!--
*Hint*:
Note that the measurement file indicates where the reconciled file should be saved. For instance, for the *R-290_LT_1.txt* file, the location is defined by the command `ARCHIVE -T Reconciled/reconc_R-290_LT_1.txt`. Make sure to have a folder named *Reconciled* in the same folder as the Vali model. -->

## Performance and cost evaluation
The purpose of this section is to evaluate the performance of the double stage heat pump and the cost of the equipments. The performance is evaluated for low temperature supply ($50Â°C$) and high temperature supply ($65Â°C$) for both fluids. The goal is to perform a regression on the second law efficiency to model its evolution with the external ambient temperature. In the last section,  data was measured on the heat pump for both fluids and both temperature levels at different external temperatures. Data reconciliation was performed with the model in order to minimize the measurements error. These results will now be used to evaluate the heat pump performance at different temperatures, and fit these measurements on a regression model. The following model will be used:
$$ C_{carnot}=a\cdot T_{ext}^2- b\cdot T_{ext}+c$$

with $T_{ext}$ the external ambient temperature. Regression is performed using AMPL, which allows to simultaneously get the equipment price. First, let's write the optimization problem for regression:
\begin{array}{l}
\min{\sum_t (C_{factor,1}(t)-C_{factor,2}(t))^2} \\
\text{ s.t.}\\
\end{array}

Lastly, the factors $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the variables to determine by thsi regression. The equipment cost can be retrieved using the following equations:

)
```

Note that cinv1 is in CHF/y and cinv2 is in CHF/kW/y. We consider that for the heat pump at low temperature, it is able to provide heat at 55Â°C and that for medium temperature, it is able to provide heat at 70Â°C. The Fmin and Fmax values are compared with a reference size of 1000 $kW_{heat}$. Data from R1270 seems to be incorrect. I'll have to work on that.

<!-- **Given**

Three AMPL files: *moes2021_P4_Rxxx.dat*, *moes2021_P4.mod* and *moes2021_P4.run*.

Table with ambient temperatures for each measurement.

**Task**

For the performance evaluation:

- Use the information in the reconciled files from VALI to complete the AMPL model.
- Derive a regression curve that calculates the Carnot factor as a polynomial function of the ambient temperature for both stages of the HP. You are asked to derive the factors *a*, *b* and *c*. In general, you can assume:

\begin{equation}
C_{Carnot}^*(t) = a \cdot T_{amb}^2(t) - b \cdot T_{amb}(t) + c
(\#eq:Carnot1)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C_{Carnot} = \frac {Q(t)}{W(t)} \cdot \frac {T_{cond}(t)-T_{evap}(t)}{T_{cond}(t)}
(\#eq:Carnot2)
\end{equation}

- Make sure to identify the evaporator and the condenser temperature of both sides accordingly. You will find some hints in the AMPL code. Note that the temperatures in Eq. \@ref(eq:Carnot2) must be in K.

For the cost evaluation:

- Assume the worst case conditions to evaluate the area of the heat exchangers, which is then fixed, and to size the other components (e.g. compressors).
Calculate the cost for the two-stage HP with cost functions provided in the literature or taken from previous sections. Consider only the costs of the heat exchangers and the compressor, since they are the main contributors to the investment cost of heat pumps. 

**Result**

Polynomial function for the Carnot factor as a function of the ambient temperature Ta.

Size of the heat exchangers and compressor.

Cost of the total system.

Unit cost of the system per kW of heating capacity. -->
